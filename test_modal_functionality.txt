This is a test file to verify that:

1. Authentication modal appears at app launch
2. Users can dismiss the modal (via close button, backdrop click, or ESC key)
3. After dismissing the modal, users can upload and convert files using public APIs
4. All functionality works without requiring authentication

Test content for conversion: Hello World! This file should convert successfully using the public API endpoints.

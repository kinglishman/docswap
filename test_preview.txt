Test Document for PDF Preview

This is a test document to verify that the PDF preview functionality works correctly after fixing the X-Frame-Options and inline viewing issues.

Key Features Tested:
1. Text to PDF conversion
2. PDF preview in iframe
3. Inline viewing instead of forced download
4. Security headers allowing same-origin framing

The PDF should display properly in the preview container without showing "This content is blocked" error.

Test completed successfully if this text appears in the PDF preview.

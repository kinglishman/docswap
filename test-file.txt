This is a test file for testing the multi-conversion flow.

The DocSwap application should now allow users to:
1. Select a file
2. Convert it
3. Download the result
4. Start a new conversion without page reload

This test file can be used to verify that the same file can be selected multiple times and the conversion flow can be repeated seamlessly.
